## Notes:

### Proton Spin Puzzle:

#### Section 1

1. EMC data suggested that quark intrinsic spin contributes little to the spin of the proton (1988).
   1. Longitudinal spin is understood, but transverse spin is not
2. Article compiles the developments of QCD spin physics
3. Big questions:
   1. Are the results from the EMC correct?
   2. How is psin distributed among the valence and sea quarks and gluons
   3. What about orbital angular momentum in the nucleon

#### Section 2: Spin Structure Functions and Parton Distributions

Brief introduction to nucleon spin physics and the experiments that have been performed to investigate it

1. Polarized deep inelastic scattering - pDIS - experiments where longitundinally polarized leptons are scattered off a longitudinal or transversly polarized nucleon at large momentum transfer ($Q^2$)
   1. Inclusive measurements are where only the scattered lepton is measured in the final state
   2. Semi-Inclusive measurements are where at least one high energy final state hadron is measured.
   3. *Question: What is the difference between transversely and longitudinally polarized particles*
   4. Measurements with longitudinally polarized targets and beams give info about the helicity distributions of quarks and glons in the nucleon
      1. At leading order, they can be though of as the difference in probability of finding a parton with longitudinal polarization parallel or anti-parallel to that of the nucleon

Start by describing concept in book, then take ten page story through the paper. Convey that you understand what they did and why they did it. Convey your excitement about the paper. 



### Connection to textbook:

1. Chapter 9 begins a discussion about electron spin - can use this to lead into the spin of proton
2. Chapter 15 discusses quarks, QCD, etc. - good place to find some starting points that connect to stuff.
3. Try to find anything about particle accelerators
   1. Nuclear reactions go into this with nuclei collisions
   2. Radiation detectors are used for detectors like CLAS12
   3. "How to find a top quark" essay - particle accelerators and detectors



### Cross Sections

1. When a quantum particle approaches another particle, there is a non-zero probability that it doesn't interact with the potential	
   1. The number of scattering events is probabilistic, so this means that the cross section is the probability of a certain process happening
   2. for particle collisions, the total cross section is the probability of measuring a specific endstate given a collision (or interaction)
      1. For example: when you collide 2 protons, whats the probability of measuring 4 leptons in the final state?
   3. the differential cross section is the probability of measuring the endstate within a range of a kinematic variable
      1. For example: when colliding 2 protons, whats the probability of measuring 4 leptons within a certain bjorken x range, or a specific
   4. A peak in a differential cross section is called a resonance, and these are very interesting
   5. *Question: So if we plot a histogram of the counts of a particle with specific Q2 values, is that its differential cross section?*
